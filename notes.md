Just some basic notes that occur while creating and fiddling with stuff.
This is sort of a living ToDo-List, so might change from time to time.

####Open:
install script: create an installation script
languages: needs multi-language support for the textual identification of the language too
categories: needs multi-language support too
listEntries: join in userName and display it instead of the userId
salt: rethink and improve salting

Optics:
    article-creation: add checkboxes for each language and only display the language forms if checkbox is set


####Done:
users-table: needs status (like active/inactive)
articles-table: needs heading too (for distinction and selection while creation of new posts)
articles: create/update needs functionality to manage category-assignment
categories: implement parent-category assignment on creation
articles: add publish-functionality to create- and edit-forms
